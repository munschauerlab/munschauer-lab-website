<p>Our new home at <a href="https://ciid-heidelberg.de/">CIID</a> places us at the heart of one of Europe’s leading hubs for biomedical research, where we look forward to expanding our work at the intersection of Molecular Virology, RNA Biology and Sytsems Biology in an inspiring, collaborative environment.</p>

<p>We are thrilled about the opportunities ahead and look forward to new scientific partnerships, discoveries, and innovations as we continue to explore the fascinating biology of human pathogenic RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates as we settle into our new space in Heidelberg!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that the Munschauer Lab is moving to the Centre for Integrative Infectious Disease Research (CIID) at Heidelberg University!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Our research highlighted in Molecular Cell</title><link href="https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/04/review.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Our research highlighted in Molecular Cell" /><published>2024-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/04/review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/04/review.html"><![CDATA[<p>Many thanks to Alfredo Castello and co-workers for prominently featuring our lastest work on SND1 and the RNA synthesis mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in Molecular Cell.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many thanks to Alfredo Castello and co-workers for prominently featuring our lastest work on SND1 and the RNA synthesis mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in Molecular Cell.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Postdoctoral Fellowship for Lisa Wendt</title><link href="https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/01/engelhorn.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Postdoctoral Fellowship for Lisa Wendt" /><published>2024-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/01/engelhorn</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.munschauerlab.de/2024/10/01/engelhorn.html"><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to Lisa Wendt for securing a highly competitive postdoctoral fellowship from the Peter &amp; Traudl Engelhorn Foundation for her work on highly pathogenic RNA viruses in our group.

With SHIFTR you can identify proteins directly bound to a specific region within any endogenous or viral RNA. In addition to delivering region-resolution, SHIFTR requires orders of magnitude lower input material compared to the state-of-the-art, thus removing a critical bottleneck. We believe SHIFTR will be a breakthrough technology and look forward to applying it broadly!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to present SHIFTR, a novel platform for region-specific RNA interactome discovery developed by PhD student Jens Aydin, now published in Nucleic Acid Research.
