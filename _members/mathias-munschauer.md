Mathias Munschauer started working with RNA and RNA-binding proteins as an undergraduate student in the lab of Thomas Tuschl at Rockefeller University in New York (USA), where he also completed his master’s thesis. He then joined an international PhD exchange program jointly operated by the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin (working with Markus Landthaler) and at New York University (working with Christine Vogel). For his postdoctoral research, he joined the lab of Eric Lander at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. In July 2019, he returned to Germany as head of an independent Helmholtz Young Investigator Group at the Helmholtz Institute Würzburg. In 2021, he was appointed as a junior professor at the University of Würzburg, and in 2023, he relocated to Goethe University Frankfurt as a W2 professor at the Institute of Medical Virology.
