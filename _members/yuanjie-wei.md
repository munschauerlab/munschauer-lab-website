Yuanjie completed her MSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. She worked on dissecting the molecular mechanism of an evolved transcription factor in cellular reprogramming by integrating genomics analysis and cellular experiments. After one-year working as a research assistant at the Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health, Guangdong Laboratory, she joined the Munschauer group as a PhD student in 2020 where she will work on how RNA-protein interactions of RNA viruses are connected to regulatory perturbations in host cells.
