Sebastian Zielinski obtained his MSc degree in Biochemistry from the Technical University of Munich (Germany). Beyond developing a strong background in virology, he worked at Ethris GmbH in Planegg (Germany) to carry out his MSc thesis project on the chromatography-based purification of mRNA for use as a transcript therapeutic. He joined the HIRI in 2020 through the Graduate Program “RNA & Infection”. After rotating through three different groups, he joined the Munschauer lab as PhD student and is now working on uncovering the role of RNA‑binding proteins in viral infections.
