Alexander Gabel obtained his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Halle/Saale (Germany). During his PhD, he developed and combined concepts and methods from machine learning and statistics to analyze transcriptomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic data. As a visiting scientist, between 2015 and 2018, he joined the Sainsbury Laboratory in Cambridge (UK), where he worked on the annotation and characterization of protein-coding splice-variants, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs in flowering plants. His current research in the Munschauer lab focuses on the development of novel computational approaches combining multi-omics data to study the role of lncRNAs within virus-host interactions.
