Lina Günter received her MSc in biochemistry from the University of Heidelberg in July 2021. As part of her master’s thesis, she investigated RNA-binding proteins in the context of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway. In October 2021, Lina joined the HIRI as a PhD student through the graduate program “RNA & Infection” and later became a member of the Munschauer lab. Her PhD project focuses on RNA-binding proteins involved in the translation and stability of RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus) RNA. In her free time, she enjoys cycling, running, and hiking.
