Nora obtained her PhD in Molecular Virology in September 2019 from the University of Zurich, where she investigated virus-host interactions and innate immune responses during influenza virus infections. During her Masterâ€™s project, she worked on herpes simplex virus infections at Imperial College London. She joined the Munschauer lab as a Postdoc in April 2020, where she is interested in understanding functional RNA-protein interactions during influenza virus replication. Outside of the lab, Nora enjoys bouldering and hiking.
