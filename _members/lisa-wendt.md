Lisa Wendt obtained her PhD from the University of Greifswald (Germany) in June 2021. During her PhD and postdoctoral research at Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute she characterized virus-host interactions of hemorrhagic fever viruses and uncovered mRNA export mechanisms from Ebola virus replication organelles. She joined the Munschauer lab as postdoctoral researcher in April 2024, where she is interested in elucidating the interplay between cellular RNA-binding proteins and Ebola virus RNA species.
