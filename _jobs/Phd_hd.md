The Munschauer Lab at the Centre for Integrative Infectious Disease Research (CIID) is seeking a highly motivated doctoral researcher in the area of Molecular Virology or RNA Biology to work on an innovative ERC-funded research project. The project is centered on the systematic functional dissection of RNA-protein complexes at the virus-host interface and will bring together experimental and computational scientists.
