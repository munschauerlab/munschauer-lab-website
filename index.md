# Welcome to the Munschauer Lab â€“ Now at Heidelberg University

We are excited to announce that the Munschauer Lab is relocating to the **Centre for Integrative Infectious Disease Research (CIID)** at **Heidelberg University**! We look forward to launching exciting new research projects at our new home. Stay tuned for more.

We are an interdisciplinary team of virologists, biochemists and computational biologists with a passion for unlocking the secrets of pathogenic RNA viruses. We are interested in learning how RNA-binding proteins shape the fate of viral RNA to influence infection outcomes. We take a systems biology-inspired approach and combine cutting-edge technologies from the area of mass spectrometry and genomics to understand the molecular interactions between RNA viruses and their hosts. Ultimately, we strive to identify novel host-dependency or antiviral mechanisms that can inspire the design of the next generation of antivirals.
