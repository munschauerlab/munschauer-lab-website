# Welcome


Our lab is located at the **Institute of Medical Virology at Goethe University** Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

We are an interdisciplinary team of biochemists, virologists and computational biologists with a passion for unlocking the secrets of pathogenic RNA viruses. We are interested in learning how RNA-binding proteins shape the fate of viral RNA to influence infection outcomes. We take a systems biology-inspired approach and combine cutting-edge technologies from the area of mass spectrometry and genomics to understand the molecular interactions between RNA viruses and their hosts. Ultimately, we strive to identify novel host-dependency or antiviral mechanisms that can inspire the design of the next generation of antivirals.
