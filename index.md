# Welcome

Our lab is currently in the process of transitioning from the **Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research** in WÃ¼rzburg, our home since 2019, to the **Institute of Medical Virology** at the **University Hospital of Goethe University Frankfurt am Main**, Germany. We look forward to launching exciting new research projects at our new home. Stay tuned.

We are an interdisciplinary team of virologists, biochemists and computational biologists with a passion for unlocking the secrets of pathogenic RNA viruses. We are interested in learning how RNA-binding proteins shape the fate of viral RNA to influence infection outcomes. We take a systems biology-inspired approach and combine cutting-edge technologies from the area of mass spectrometry and genomics to understand the molecular interactions between RNA viruses and their hosts. Ultimately, we strive to identify novel host-dependency or antiviral mechanisms that can inspire the design of the next generation of antivirals.
