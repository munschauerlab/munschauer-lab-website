Viruses are a burden to human health. Identifying host cell factors that bind and regulate viral RNA during the infection processes is important for understanding how viruses can take over a host cell, subvert host processes and escape innate immune defense mechanisms. Insights into the underlying molecular interactions and mechanisms contribute towards the development of the next generation of rationally designed antivirals. 

We take an innovative RNA-centric approach that combines RNA interactomics techniques (e.g. RAP-MS, SHIFTR) with functional inference strategies (e.g. Perturb-seq) to identify and characterize novel pro- or antiviral mechanisms. Through the discovery and characterization of such mechanisms we hope to contribute to the development of the next generation of antivirals.

## Highlights

How SARS-CoV-2 initiates its replication process during infection is not yet fully understood. [In a recent publication in the journal Cell](https://doi.org/gstdzg), we show that it is the human protein SND1 which works together with the viral protein NSP9 to stimulate the virus’s genetic replication program in infected cells.
