We are proud to present SHIFTR, a novel platform for region-specific RNA interactome discovery developed by PhD student Jens Aydin, now published in Nucleic Acid Research.
With SHIFTR you can identify proteins directly bound to a specific region within any endogenous RNA. In addition to delivering region-resolution, SHIFTR requires orders of magnitude lower input material compared to the state-of-the-art, thus removing a critical bottleneck. We believe SHIFTR will be a breakthrough technology and look forward to applying it broadly!
