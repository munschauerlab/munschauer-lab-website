We are excited to announce that the Munschauer Lab is relocating to the **Centre for Integrative Infectious Disease Research (CIID)** at **Heidelberg University**!

Our new home at CIID places us at the heart of one of Europeâ€™s leading hubs for biomedical research, where we look forward to expanding our work at the intersection of Molecular Virology, RNA Biology and Sytsems Biology in an inspiring, collaborative environment.

We are thrilled about the opportunities ahead and look forward to new scientific partnerships, discoveries, and innovations as we continue to explore the fascinating biology of human pathogenic RNA viruses.

Stay tuned for updates as we settle into our new space in Heidelberg!
