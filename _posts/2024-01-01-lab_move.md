Exciting times ahead - the lab is moving to Frankfurt am Main, Germany. We are joining the Institute of Medical Virology at Goethe University Frankfurt. This move has been made possible by generous support from the state of Hesse (LOEWE-Spitzenprofessur) and the Willy Robert Pitzer foundation that will fund our research for the next decade!
